• Implement comprehensive logging with multiple severity levels:
    - DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging

    - WARNING: Indication of potential issues
    - ERROR: Errors that don't terminate execution
    - CRITICAL: Critical errors causing termination

• Configure logging to support both file and stdout outputs

• Add structured logging for better searchability
• Implement log rotation for production environments
