    Do a full security, code quality scan of project.

    Also do an impact/severity review and list major impacts of project. 
    i.e. does the script deleting entire databases, make major updates...
    list changes in terms of severity with details (Criticial, severe, major, minor...) 
    
    Create seperate final report files each for security, code smells and severity analyses and place in a `requirements/` subdirectory.
