# Security Scan Report

This report details the security findings for the Email Triage Application.

## Critical Security Findings

### 1. Gmail Authentication Mechanism for Server Deployment
*   **File(s) Affected**: `src/gmail_service/gmail_client.py`
*   **Issue**: The application currently uses Google's `InstalledAppFlow` for Gmail authentication. This flow is designed for CLI tools or local applications where a user can manually interact with a browser for OAuth 2.0 authorization. It is **unsuitable and insecure for an unattended server-side application**.
*   **Risk**: If deployed as a server application, it will fail to re-authenticate after the initial token expires, or it cannot be deployed in a fully automated, unattended manner. Storing user-authorized credentials (`credentials.json`) on a server long-term also poses risks if not handled with extreme care.
*   **Recommendation**: **Critically important to switch to Google Service Account authentication.** This involves:
    1.  Creating a Service Account in the Google Cloud Console.
    2.  Granting it the necessary IAM permissions for the Gmail API (e.g., `Gmail API Service Agent` or custom roles allowing read/modify access as needed by the application) and Google Pub/Sub.
    3.  Downloading the Service Account's JSON key file.
    4.  Configuring the application (e.g., via the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRETS_JSON_PATH` environment variable) to use this key file.
    5.  Modifying the `_get_gmail_service` method in `src/gmail_service/gmail_client.py` to use `google.oauth2.service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file`. Comments indicating this are already in the code.

## High Priority Security Findings

### 1. Secrets Management and Exposure
*   **File(s) Affected**: `src/core/config.py`, deployment environment (e.g., `.env` file).
*   **Issue**: The application relies on several sensitive secrets:
    *   `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY` (if an OpenAI model were used, currently using local Transformers models)
    *   Google Cloud credentials (either `client_secret.json` for the current OAuth flow or a service account key file for the recommended flow).
    While the use of environment variables (via `python-dotenv` and `os.getenv`) is a good practice, the overall security depends on how these are managed in the deployment environment.
*   **Risk**: Accidental exposure of these secrets (e.g., committing a `.env` file, insecure file permissions, or insecure injection into the environment) could lead to unauthorized access to Gmail, Slack, or other configured services.
*   **Recommendations**:
    *   **`.env` File Security**: The `.env` file is correctly listed in `.gitignore`. Ensure it is never committed to version control.
    *   **Secure File Permissions**: If credential files (like a service account JSON key) are stored on the server, they must have strict file permissions (e.g., readable only by the application's user).
    *   **Production Secrets Management**: For production deployments, use a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or platform-provided secure environment variable injection). Avoid storing plain text secret files on disk if possible.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure API keys and tokens have only the minimum necessary permissions (scopes) required for the application to function.

## Medium Priority Security Findings

### 1. Potentially Sensitive Data in Logs
*   **File(s) Affected**: `src/main.py`, `src/ai_service/ai_processor.py`, `src/utils/logger.py`.
*   **Issue**: Debug log statements, particularly in `src/ai_service/ai_processor.py` (e.g., logging raw AI model outputs) and potentially in `src/main.py` (e.g. logging email subjects or snippets), could include parts of email content or personally identifiable information (PII).
*   **Risk**: If `DEBUG` level logging is enabled in a production environment, or if logs are not stored and accessed securely, sensitive information could be exposed.
*   **Recommendations**:
    *   Review all `logger.debug()` and `logger.info()` statements that handle or output email data or AI processing results.
    *   Avoid logging full email bodies or extensive sensitive snippets unless strictly necessary for temporary debugging.
    *   Ensure `DEBUG` log level is disabled in production environments, or that debug logs are routed to a secure, restricted-access location.
    *   Consider sanitizing or redacting sensitive information from logs if detailed logging is required.

## Informational Security Considerations

### 1. Slack Bot Token Scopes
*   **Component**: Slack Integration (`src/slack_service/slack_client.py`)
*   **Consideration**: The security of the Slack integration also depends on the OAuth scopes granted to the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`. Ensure the token has the principle of least privilege applied (e.g., only `chat:write` to the specific required channel, not broader permissions). This is an operational check in the Slack App's configuration.

### 2. Service Account Key Security (if `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is used for Pub/Sub)
*   **Component**: Pub/Sub Listener (`src/gmail_service/pubsub_listener.py`)
*   **Consideration**: The `PubSubListener` can use Application Default Credentials (ADC). If running outside a GCP environment where ADC is configured, it would rely on the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable pointing to a service account key file. The security of this key file is critical.

### 3. AI Model Provenance and Safety (Local Models)
*   **Component**: AI Processing (`src/ai_service/ai_processor.py`)
*   **Consideration**: The application uses pre-trained models from Hugging Face Hub, loaded locally. While the `transformers` library is generally secure, there's an implicit trust in the model publishers. For the currently used models (standard ones like DistilBERT and BART), this risk is low. If custom or less-known models were to be used, their source and safety should be vetted. The primary risk with local models is not arbitrary code execution but rather resource consumption or potentially biased/unexpected outputs.
